# putts.io client

React application with `mobx-state-tree` as a state management. Slowly becoming into PWA aka Progressive Web App as we intend to use this in mobile.

## development

`git clone`, `npm install`, usual stuff

We use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as a development server. Data is in `dev-server`-folder. And for the port `3090`. So the command to run server is `npm run dev-server`.
